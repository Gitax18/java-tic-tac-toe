# Simple Multiplayer _Tic-Tac-Toe_ in java

From the past 2 weeks, I am learning JAVA programming language and
after covering all the basics I thought of making an simple project in this language,
and I decided to build our childhood favorite game, Tic-Tac-Toe.

I have build basic functionalities in the game, like checking winner, 
putting character to grid etc.
